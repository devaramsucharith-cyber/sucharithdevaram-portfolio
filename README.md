# Sucharith Devaram

## Entry-Level Physical Design & Verification Engineer

I am a graduate Electrical & Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in
**Physical Design and Digital Verification** for semiconductor systems.

My academic and project experience focuses on understanding the complete digital
design flow — from RTL development and functional verification to synthesis,
timing analysis, and testability-aware design.
